# JavaScript Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly JavaScript programs written for practice and learning purposes. Each file demonstrates a specific concept in JavaScript such as variables, operators, conditionals, loops, and object manipulation.

## Files Overview

### 1. `one.js`
- Demonstrates variable declaration using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Shows dynamic typing in JavaScript (`null`, `undefined`, `boolean` types).
- Includes `console.log` and `typeof` for output and type inspection.
- Contains a `const` reassignment error intentionally for learning.

### 2. `two.js`
- Creates and manipulates a `Student` object.
- Demonstrates accessing object properties using dot and bracket notation.
- Shows usage of basic arithmetic operators.
- Increments and logs values using `a++` and `++b`.

### 3. `three.js`
- Takes user input using `prompt`.
- Checks whether the entered number is a multiple of 5 using conditional statements (`if-else`).

### 4. `four.js`
- Accepts a numeric score via `prompt`.
- Assigns a grade based on the score using a chain of `if-else` conditions.
- Covers edge cases from 0 to 100 and gives feedback if the user fails.

## How to Run

To run any of the JavaScript files:
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect).
2. Go to the Console tab.
3. Paste the contents of the `.js` file and press Enter.
   - If the file uses `prompt()`, input values in the popup dialogs.

Alternatively, you can use an online editor like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), or [Replit](https://replit.com/) to run these scripts.
